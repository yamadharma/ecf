;;; When you have an active region that spans multiple lines, the following will add a cursor to each line
(global-set-key (kbd "C-S-c C-S-c") 'mc/edit-lines)

;;; When you want to add multiple cursors not based on continuous lines, but based on keywords in the buffer, use:
(global-set-key (kbd "C->") 'mc/mark-next-like-this)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-<") 'mc/mark-previous-like-this)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-<") 'mc/mark-all-like-this)

;;; Binding mouse events
(global-set-key (kbd "C-S-<mouse-1>") 'mc/add-cursor-on-click)
