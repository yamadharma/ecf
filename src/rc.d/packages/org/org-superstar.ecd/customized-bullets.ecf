;;; Customized Bullets and Terminal Fallback -*- coding: utf-8-unix; -*-
;; First off, let’s make bullets a little more chunky. Mind that the
;; height we provide for bullet faces is not the actual height of a
;; bullet, but its height relative to its surroundings. Additionally,
;; let’s hide the leading stars for terminal sessions, as the default
;; leader does not look all that good in my chosen terminal font. I
;; make use of the fact that org-superstar-leading-fallback can be set
;; to the space character. This has the nice advantage over
;; org-hide-leading-stars that it does not just “paint over” the
;; asterisks, but makes them completely indistinguishable from white
;; space, neat!
