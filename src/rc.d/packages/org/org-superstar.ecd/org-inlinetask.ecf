;;; Org Inline Tasks -*- coding: utf-8-unix; -*-
;; Inline tasks behave as you would expect them to, for the most
;; part. They have two bullets instead of one, but are otherwise
;; treated the same as regular headlines by Org Superstar, meaning
;; org-superstar-headline-bullets-list controls the bullet used as if
;; it were a regular headline. If org-inlinetask-show-first-star is
;; non-nil, you can customize the additional marker. Just like with
;; the rest of Superstarâ€™s decorations, you can more or less fully
;; control how it looks, with independent settings for graphical and
;; terminal displays and a dedicated face, should you find the default
;; of using org-warn a littleâ€¦ unsubtle. We again use the LaTeX setup
;; as a base and add a few tweaks.
